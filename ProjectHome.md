This is a very easy text classifier using a naive bayes algorithm. You might want to use it for educational purposes or as a starting point for a more sophisticated classifier.

Although the algorithm is very basic, the results are quite good if you feed it with good category data.

Output could look like this:

```
python classify.py
test is bibel with 0.884580618272 % probability
test is christmascarol with 0.0 % probability
test is java course with 0.0 % probability
test is max und moritz with 0.0 % probability
test is tom sawyer and huckleberry finn with 0.0 % probability

The test text is probably from bibel
